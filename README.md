AutoFileBackup can monitor files for modifications and automatically create a backup of the new version. Despite its simplicity, it comes in handy to all users, especially programmers.

Forthright appearance and accessible functions on AutoFileBackup
----------------------------------------------------------------

Ease of use is one of the main characteristics of this application, which is clearly reflected by the user-friendly interface. The tab-based GUI offers fast access to all the functions, making the configuration process a breeze.

Monitor all types of files and automatically back them up with AutoFileBackup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **File Monitor** tab is where you can manage all your files and view the event log. AutoFileBackup can supervise any type of file, whether it is a plain text file, an image, a video or an audio file, a programming-related document or any other format you might think of.

Editing one of the monitored files and saving the new version is what triggers the application to create a backup. You can set it to save the copy to a specific location or to a sub-folder in the same directory as the original.

In addition to this, you can customize the name of the backup file using prefixes and suffixes or optionally inserting the current date and time within the name, so that you can easily view the last time you made changes to the file.

Creates backups of files as they are being modified with AutoFileBackup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As its name suggests, AutoFileBackup can automate the process of backing up files as they are modified. No matter the type of file you want it to keep an eye on, it performs its job without any error, creating a safe copy with a custom name and saving it locally or to a removable drive.
